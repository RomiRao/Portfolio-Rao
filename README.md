### ✦ Projects

At this section you can see most of the projects I've been working on.

On every card you will be able to se an image and a description of what's about.
Also you can see some tags that show the knowledge applied on that project.

Also you have two buttons that lead you to the repositories and deployment of every project, in case you want to check the code and not only the website.

### ✦ Contact

Nothing else than my beautiful face. (?)
Just a small description of me and what I know, also, because I love spam myself, the links to my LinkedIn and mail.

## NEW KNOWLEDGE APPLIED

### ✦ Firestore

I've been tought about firestore apart of what we were learning on ADA so I decided to apply it here to learn better, also because it was better for me to put my projects information on a database instead of a huge and innecesary array inside the code.
